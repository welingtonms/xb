# Getting started

**Welcome to `@welingtonms/xb-wc`**, thank you very much for being here.

**This is my canvas**, my library of components I'm building for my own enjoyment. Here is the playground where I come when I want to practice, have some cool idea, or prototype something I need to build.

I've been putting my heart here and I do hope someone can make good use of it as much as I do.
