**Welcome to `@welingtonms/xb-wc`**, thank you very much for being here.

**This is my canvas**, my library of components I'm building for my own enjoyment. Here is the playground where I come when I want to practice, have some cool idea, or work on a proof of concept of something I need to build.

I've been putting my heart here and I do hope someone can make good use of it as much as I do.

<!-- ## Using this project

You can use either `npm` or `yarn` to manage dependencies for this project, and to run the scripts available for your your convenience.

Or with `yarn`:

`yarn add @welingtonms/xb-wc`

## Configuring _Babel_

This project is build only as [ESModule](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/); to keep our bundled code as clean as possible, I try to use the latest possible ECMAScript version as target. That mean, if you have to support browsers that don't support certain modern ECMAScript features, you may want to configure your build tools accordingly. Here's an example for Babel:

```js
// babel.config.js
const path = require('path');
module.exports {
  include: [
    ...,
    path.resolve('node_modules/@welingtonms/xb-wc'),
  ],
  ...
}
``` -->
